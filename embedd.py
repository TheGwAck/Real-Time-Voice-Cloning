#Steps to get embedding:
#1. Main function to compute embeddings of a batch of utterances is embed_utterance( in inference.py for RTVC and in voice.encoder.py for Resemblyzer)
# 2.After the batch you need to gorup them in speakers and use ember speakers for that. (embed_speaker is not implemented for RTVC
# and is in the voice.encoder.py file for resemblyzer)
